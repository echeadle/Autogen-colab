            "\n",
            "1. **Sprint Planning**: In the first sprint planning meeting, we will discuss the requirements in detail, break them down into user stories, and estimate the effort required for each task.\n",

            "5. **Review and Retrospective**: At the end of each sprint, we will review the completed work with the product manager and stakeholders. We will also conduct a retrospective to identify areas of improvement for the next sprint.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Deployment**: Once the features are approved, we will deploy the website to a staging environment for further testing before final deployment.\n",

            "7. **Feedback and Iteration**: We will gather feedback from users and stakeholders to make any necessary iterations for continuous improvement.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Frontend Development**: Designing the user interface for the website, allowing employees to submit HR requests and track their status. This will involve using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Backend Development**: Implementing the logic to handle HR requests, store data in a database, and provide APIs for the frontend to interact with. This will likely involve using a server-side language like Python, Java, or Node.js.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Database Design**: Designing the database schema to store employee HR requests, user information, and any other relevant data. We will need to consider the relationships between different entities and ensure data integrity.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Security**: Implementing security measures to protect sensitive employee data, such as encryption, authentication, and access control.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Integration**: If the website needs to integrate with other systems or services, we will need to plan for the integration points and ensure seamless communication between the website and external systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "By collaborating with the product manager and scrum master, we will ensure that the technical implementation aligns with the product requirements and is delivered within the sprint timelines. Let's work together to create a successful website for tracking employee HR requests.\n",
